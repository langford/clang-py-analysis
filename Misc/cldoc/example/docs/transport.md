#<cldoc:transport>

The transport namespace.

The transport namespace contains various classes used for transportation. This
namespace contains only the *best* types of transportation (i.e. bycicles).
Please have a look at the base <Bicycle> class. If you are more interested
in cycling on the road, you can check out the <RacingBike> class. If you're
more of an offroad type of person then a <MountainBike> might be more for you.
